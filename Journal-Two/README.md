The AirPods Pro, first released in late 2019, is Apple's first wireless in-ear headphones and has quickly become one of my most frequently used devices. Like most products that Apple makes, the physical design of the case and earbuds are quite good. An all-white plastic case with a metal hinge that feels satisfying to snap open and close, and a pair of earbuds that look like the original Airpods, except with a bent stem and silicone tips, that also snap into place in the case. The earbuds themselves also feel high quality and for the most part, fit well into my ears and don’t irritate them either. 

The main reason why I bought them was that my AirPods 2 were starting to show wear and tear and because I wanted something with noise cancelation. Ambient noises such as wind, fans, and traffic bother me when I'm trying to focus, so I wanted something to block out those sounds, and the AirPods Pro work amazingly in this regard. This brings me to a problem that has annoyed me since I bought them, which is the **visibility of system status**, or how much feedback a product gives back to the user, of the three different noise control options. Let’s say you wanted to change the noise control setting to noise-canceling, then you would simply hold down on the stem. Doing this would switch to the next setting, and while there is haptic feedback for letting you know that the mode has changed, there is no way to tell which setting you changed it to. And in low noise areas, it can be difficult to tell which setting you're on, which leads me to have to tell by the ambient noise if they’re in transparency mode, noise-canceling, or normal.

Another issue that I have with the AirPods Pro that I feel is persistent across all Apple products is the **flexibility and efficiency of use**, or shortcuts and personalization options. For example, with the noise control options, there is no quick way to change them without holding down on the stem. If you want to change the noise control on your iPhone, you have to go into the Bluetooth menu in the settings app, click on the ‘i’ icon, and only then can you change what mode you’re on. The ‘i’ icon also appears on all connected Bluetooth devices, so there is no way to know that Apple has hidden settings here because every device has it. While this isn’t an issue for me anymore as I can differentiate between the modes, when I first got them and was having trouble, it was very cumbersome having to go into three different menus to change a simple option that should have been included on the drop-down quick menu.
